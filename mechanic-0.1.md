# Mechanic 0.1

This document describes concrete mechanics that operate under the invariants in [System Notes v0.1](./README.md). System Notes remain the stable reference for identity, time, state, execution, and risk.

## Scope

Mechanic 0.1 covers the first set of player-facing and system-facing procedures: what can be submitted, how it is validated, and how state changes.

(Content to be filled as mechanics are specified.)

## Reference

- [System Notes v0.1](./README.md) — invariants, identity, time, state, execution model, risk, adversarial assumptions, gaps, boundaries.
